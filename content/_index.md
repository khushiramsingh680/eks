## Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a fully-managed, certified Kubernetes conformant service that simplifies the process of building, securing, operating, and maintaining Kubernetes clusters on AWS. Amazon EKS integrates with core AWS services such as CloudWatch, Auto Scaling Groups, and IAM to provide a seamless experience for monitoring, scaling, and load balancing your containerized applications. 

# Amazon EKS Pointers

## 1. Setting Up EKS
- **IAM Roles and Policies**:
  - Ensure proper IAM roles for EKS to manage AWS resources.
  - Use `eksctl` or AWS Management Console for creating the EKS cluster, ensuring roles are assigned.
- **Networking**:
  - Set up VPC, subnets (private and public), security groups, and route tables.
  - Use AWS Load Balancer Controller for services requiring external access.
- **Cluster Autoscaler**:
  - Configure Cluster Autoscaler for automatic scaling of worker nodes.
  - Ensure proper IAM permissions and tags for Auto Scaling Groups (ASG).

---

## 2. Security Best Practices
- **RBAC**: Implement fine-grained Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for cluster access.
- **IAM Integration**: Use IAM roles for service accounts to control pod-level AWS resource access.
- **Private Endpoint**: Limit API server access by enabling private endpoints.
- **Node Security**:
  - Regularly patch and update AMIs.
  - Use Bottlerocket OS for container-optimized security.

---

## 3. Deployment and Scaling
- **Managed Node Groups**:
  - Use managed node groups for easy lifecycle management of worker nodes.
- **Fargate**:
  - Use Fargate profiles for serverless pods if workloads are lightweight and bursty.
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**:
  - Set up HPA to scale pods based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics.

---

## 4. Observability
- **Monitoring**:
  - Integrate with Amazon CloudWatch for logs and metrics.
  - Use Prometheus and Grafana for more detailed monitoring.
- **Logging**:
  - Enable Fluentd or Fluent Bit for centralized log collection.
  - Forward logs to CloudWatch or third-party tools (e.g., Elasticsearch, Datadog).
- **Tracing**:
  - Integrate AWS X-Ray for application tracing.

---

## 5. CI/CD Integration
- Use AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins, or GitLab CI/CD to deploy workloads to EKS.
- Leverage Kubernetes-native tools like ArgoCD or FluxCD for GitOps workflows.

---

## 6. Storage Integration
- Use Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) for persistent storage.
- For shared storage, leverage Amazon Elastic File System (EFS).
- Utilize AWS S3 for object storage via S3-compatible tools like MinIO.

---

## 7. Cost Optimization
- **Spot Instances**:
  - Use EC2 Spot Instances for cost-effective node pools.
  - Combine On-Demand and Spot Instances with Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler.
- **Right-Sizing**:
  - Monitor resource utilization to ensure proper sizing of pods and nodes.
- **Savings Plans**:
  - Leverage Compute Savings Plans to reduce costs on EC2 instances used in EKS.

---

## 8. Upgrades
- Regularly update the EKS cluster control plane version.
- Ensure compatibility of worker node AMIs before upgrading the cluster.

---

## 9. Add-ons
- Use native Amazon EKS add-ons like:
  - **AWS App Mesh**: For service mesh capabilities.
  - **AWS Load Balancer Controller**: For managing ALBs and NLBs.
  - **CoreDNS, KubeProxy**: Ensure they're updated for DNS resolution and networking.

---

## 10. Troubleshooting
- **Diagnostics**:
  - Use `kubectl describe`, `kubectl logs`, and `kubectl events` to debug pod and node issues.
- **AWS Tools**:
  - Leverage AWS Trusted Advisor and CloudWatch Logs Insights for EKS health checks.
- **Cluster Health**:
  - Use tools like `eksctl` and AWS CLI for status checks of nodes and control plane.
