## What is Amazon EKS

Amazon EKS is a managed service that is used to run Kubernetes on AWS. Using EKS users donâ€™t have to maintain a Kubernetes control plan on their own.
It is used to automate the deployment, scaling, and maintenance of the containerized application. It works with most operating systems.
